<h2>Companion Frequency of M-Dwarfs</h2>
<p>Winter 2018, in collaboration with Prof. Micheal Meyer</p>
<p>This research explores nature of M-dwarf binaries by comparing the companion frequency derived from 
	two surveys which used different detection methods. This is done over a fixed mass ratio (q > .6)
	and the ranges of separations (semi-major axis, a) these surveys are complete for. We were able to
	fit a model to the point estimates of the frequencies and use this to extrapolate a <bold> total multiplicity 
	fraction over all q [0,1] and a[0,âˆž] of .60. </bold>
