<h2>Companion Mass Ratio Distribution</h2>

<p>Fall 2016 - Summer 2017, in collaboration with Prof. Micheal Meyer</p>
<p>For my first research project at UofM, I focused on the companion mass ratio distribution (CMRD) of M-dwarf stars. The goal was to find how the ratio of the masses of the primary star and secondary star varied with orbital separation. I started by collecting mass and separation data for M dwarf binary systems across a number of different surveys. Begininning with a direct imaging survey, I split the given data in half into two equal sized bins based on separation. I then performed the KS test, which told me that the the distribution were not drawn from the same parent population. This indicated that the companion mass ratio does not have a correlation with variation in orbital separation. I then continued my research and found a radial velocity survey. After running the KS test on the direct imaging and radial velocity surveys, similar results are found. In the near future, I will run the test again using a microlensing survey to confirm my results.</p>
