<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="head.jpg" width=15% height=20% border=2>
<p>I am a rising sophomore at the Univeristy of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I am majoring in astronomy & astrophysics, and currently planning to minor in physics, space engineering, and history. My interests in astronomy include stellar evolution, exoplanets, and cosmology. I am eager to participate in research oppurtunities that involve these subjects. I am currently a member of the FEPS (Formation and evolution of planetary systems) research group with Prof. Micheal Meyer. Some of my work is detailed on other parts of this website. I am also a member of the Michigan Mars Rover science subteam, in which I aid with scientific tests pertaining to the possibility of life on Mars. I have experience with Python, HTML, and C++. I speak some French. My interests outside of academia include baseball, video games, and hanging out with friends.</p>
