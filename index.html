<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="head.jpg" width=15% height=20% border=2>
<p>I am a sophomore at the Univeristy of Michigan - Ann Arbor majoring in astronomy and astrophysics. I currently plan to minor in physics and space engineering. My interests in astronomy include stellar evolution, exoplanets, and cosmology. I am currently a member of the FEPS (Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems) research group with Prof. Micheal Meyer at UofM. Some of my work is detailed on other parts of this website. I am also a member of the Michigan Mars Rover build team, in which I lead the science subteam. I have experience with Python, HTML/CSS, and C++. I also speak some French. My interests outside of academia include baseball, video games, and outdoor activities.</p>
